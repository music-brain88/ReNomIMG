How to Use ReNomIMG GUI tool
============================

Start the Application
----------------------

ReNomIMG is a single page web application.
If your installation have done successfully, 
you can run application in any directory with following commands.

.. code-block :: shell

    cd workspace # Workspace can be any directory in your pc. 
    renom_img # This command will starts ReNomIMG GUI server.

For the command ``renom_img``, you can give following arguments.

* --host : This specifies server address.
* --port : This specifies port number of the server.

For example, following code runs ReNomIMG with port 8888.

.. code-block :: shell

    renom_img --port 8888 # Running ReNomIMG with port 8888

If the application server runs, open web browser and type the 
server address to the address bar like this.

.. image:: /_static/image/how_to_use_start.png

Then the application will be appeared.


.. _dir_structure:

Place your dataset
------------------

When the server starts, ``datasrc`` directory and ``storage`` directory
will be created in the server running directory.

The ``datasrc`` directory has following folder structure.

.. code-block :: shell

    datasrc/
      ├── img   # Set training img files here.
      ├── label 
      │   ├── classification # Set classification training label files here
      │   ├── detection	     # Set detection training label files here
      │   └── segmentation   # Set segmentation training label files here
      └── prediction_set
            ├── img     # Set prediction img files here.
            └── output  # Prediction result will be output here.
            	  ├── classofication # Set classofication training label files here.
            	  ├── detection      # Set detection training label files here.
            	  │     ├── csv
                  │     └── xml
            	  └── segmentation   # Set segmentation training label files here.

As written in the above comments, please set training image data to ``datasrc/img``,
set training label data to ``datasrc/label``.

.. note::

    The name of image file and corresponded label file name have to be same.
    For example, the image file name is ``image01.jpg``, corresponded label file name
    have to be ``image01.xml``.


Format of the Detection data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Format of image files** : ReNomIMG only accepts ``JPEG`` and ``PNG`` formatted image files.

Format of the Segmentation data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning::
    Segmentation require two kind of labels. 
    ``PNG`` files and ``class_map.txt`` 

**Format of image files** : ReNomIMG only accepts ``JPEG`` and ``PNG`` formatted image files.

**Format of label files** : ReNomIMG only accepts ``txt`` and ``PNG`` formatted label files.
The format of txt file is bellow.

Please Save as ``class_map.txt`` .

**Put file here**:``<ReNomIMG dir>/datasrc/label/segmentation/class_map.txt``

Good example

* Class number id must be start 0 and  set background.
* Class number id must be serial number.

.. code-block :: shell

       background 0
       airplane 1
       bicycle 2
       bird 3
       boat 4
       bottle 5

.. role:: red

:red:`Bad example`

* Class number id does not start 0.
* Class name does not have background.
* Class number does not have serial number.

.. note:: 
    The name of image file and corresponded label file name have to be same.
    For example, the image file name is ``image01.jpg``, corresponded label file name
    have to be ``image01.png``.


Create Detection Model
----------------------

So far, the server and dataset are prepared. Let's build a object detection model.
For building a model, you have to specify ``dataset`` and ``hyper parameters``.

Create Dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For training a machine learning model, you have to prepare training dataset and validation dataset.
Training dataset is used for training model, and validation dataset is used for
evaluating a model in terms of how accurately predict data that have not used in training.

In ReNomIMG, training dataset and validation dataset will be **randomly** sampled from the data
that is in the ``datasrc`` directory.

.. image:: /_static/image/how_to_use_gui_datasrc.png

According to the above figure, you can create ``dataset`` from datasrc.
Once a dataset is created its content will never be change.

For creating a ``dataset``, please move to dataset setting modal. Following figures
guide you to the dataset page.

.. image:: /_static/image/how_to_use_gui_dataset_create_button01.png

Then following page will be appeared.

.. image:: /_static/image/how_to_use_gui_dataset_create_button02.png

As you can see, you can specify the ``dataset name``, ``description`` and ``ratio of training data``.

After filling all forms, please push the ``confirm`` button to confirm the content that 
the dataset includes.

.. image:: /_static/image/how_to_use_gui_dataset_create_button03.png

Then following graph will be appeared. You can confirm what classes are included 
in the dataset and how many tags are they.

At last, for saving the dataset, please push the ``submit`` button.

You can confirm created datasets in the dataset page.
For going to the dataset page, please follow the figure below.

.. image:: /_static/image/how_to_use_gui_dataset_create_button04.png

.. image:: /_static/image/how_to_use_gui_dataset_create_button05.png

In the above figure, 2 datasets are already created. 

Hyper parameter setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far you got all the materials, let's build a model and run training.
For creating a model please push the button ``New``.

.. image:: /_static/image/how_to_use_gui_model_create01.png

Then you can see a hyper parameter setting modal like following figure.

.. image:: /_static/image/how_to_use_gui_model_create02.png

As you can see in above figure, you can specify following parameters.

* **Dataset Name** ... Select the dataset for training.
* **CNN architecture** ... Select the object detection algorithm.
* **Batch Size** ... Set higher number, the learning speed become **fast**. Set lower number, the behavior  become like **Stochastic Gradient Descent(or just SGD)**
* **Total Eopch** ... Training your network on each item of the set once is an epoch.
* **Train Whole network** ... If this is  checked, whole network weight will be trained.
* **Image size** ... Image size for training.
.. note::

    Depending on your GPU device, larger image size or batch size causes memory overflow.


Training Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finishing hyper parameter settings, then **push run button to start training!**

If the training starts, model will be appeared in model list and progress bar will be shown.

.. image:: /_static/image/how_to_use_gui_model_create03.png

.. note::

  Detection, Segmentation and Classification task take same process.


Perform Prediction
------------------

After finishing the training, we can use the model for predicting new image data.

In the 'Train Page' you can see `Deploy` button. The deployed model will be used for performing prediction.
If any model is deployed you will see following view.

.. image:: /_static/image/how_to_use_gui_prediction_deploy_button.png

Then please move to 'Predict Page' using the side bar menu.
The following picture is a 'Prediction Page'.

.. image:: /_static/image/how_to_use_gui_prediction_button.png
    :scale: 80 %


You will see `Run Prediction` button. Pushing this button runs the prediction using deployed model.

.. note::

    The input image of the prediction will be the images that aligned to `datasrc/prediction_set/img`.
    Required directory structure is described in :ref:`Place your dataset<dir_structure>` .


After the prediction you will see the result on the screen like following picture.


.. image:: /_static/image/how_to_use_gui_prediction_result.png
    :scale: 80 %


Also you can download the result as csv file. The button placed on the right top of the
prediction result allows you to download the result.

Uninstall ReNomIMG
------------------

You can uninstall ReNomIMG by following pip command.

.. code-block :: shell

    pip uninstall renom_img
